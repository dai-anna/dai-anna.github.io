### Research Projects
**Drug Diversion Intervention**, Capstone Project, Keynote Presentation
- Worked with Duke Anesthesiology to tackle the issue of drug diversion by anesthesiologists
- Developed a complete modeling approach to detect potential diversion behavior based off surgical data

**Robust and IP-Protecting Vertical Federated Learning against Unexpected Quitting of Parties**, Paper in Review
- Assisted with research on robustness of vertical federated learning convolutional models against unexpected exit of inactive parties
- Completed literature review on possible defenses against various adversarial attacks, implemented the defenses to benchmark results, and reviewed code for different adversarial attacks
- Co-authored paper for submission to the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2023


### Machine Learning and Deep Learning

**NLP Models Benchmarking**, Team Project ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/Duke-NLP-FinalProject) | [Research Report](https://github.com/dai-anna/Duke-NLP-FinalProject/blob/main/report/report_submission_flat.pdf))
- Collected data on seven different topics on twitter, leveraging Twint and Twitter API
- Built an LDA generative model as well as a discriminative Neural Network to benchmark their performance in topic classification

**Semi-supervised/Representation Learning Benchmarking**, Team Project ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/SemiSupervisedBenchmarking) | [Research Report](https://github.com/dai-anna/SemiSupervisedBenchmarking/blob/main/report/ECE661_Final_Project.pdf) | [Poster](https://github.com/dai-anna/SemiSupervisedBenchmarking/blob/main/poster/ECE661%20Poster_RepLearning.pdf))
- Implemented SimCLR and RotNet framework with ResNet20 backbone encoder to benchmark model performance on limited labeled CIFAR10 data

**Deep Reinforcement Learning vs Deep Learning Recommendation Systems**, Team Project ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/DRLvsDLrecommenders))
- Implemented and benchmarked performance of deep reinforcement learning recommenders (SNQN and SA2C) against deep learning recommender (Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)) on Diginetica and Retail Rocket datasets

**Hybrid Recommendation System** ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/RenttheRunwayRecommendations) | [Research Report](https://github.com/dai-anna/RenttheRunwayRecommendations/blob/main/report/RTRRecommendationsFinalReport.pdf) | [Presentation](https://youtu.be/PzAVR38oM6Y))
- Developed hybrid recommendation system for fashion rental industry by first segmenting customers using unsupervised clustering methods then recommending items within each segment
- Benchmarked performance of hybrid system on the Rent the Runway dataset against making recommendations on the fullset and found improved performance in some segments

**Haiku Generator**, WIP ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/DeepLearning-HaikuGenerator))
- Intend to experiment with different deep learning models to tokenize corpus by syllables to generate Haikus using other deep learning NLP models


### Statistical Modeling 
**Compensation Analysis of the U.S. Technology Sector** ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/StackOverflow2021Survey-RegressionAnalysis) | [Research Report](https://github.com/dai-anna/StackOverflow2021Survey-RegressionAnalysis/blob/main/30_results/final_report.pdf))
- Used 2021 Stack Overflow Annual Survey data to regress total compensation of employed U.S. developers on experience and demographic variables to draw conclusions on if race or gender plays a significant role in receiving higher compensation
- Performed data cleansing using R scripts on self-reported survey data with multi-selection responses, significant missing data, and outliers to build a hierarchical linear regression model differing by US States

### Cloud Data Engineering
**AWS Cloud-Native Automatic Tweet Generator**, Team Project ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/AWSCloud-TweetGenerator))
- Built using Python an Amazon Web Service cloud-native end-to-end data-scraping and processing pipeline that automatically generates Tweets for currently trending hashtags with machine learning model (Hidden Markov and N-Gram model)
- Orchestrated pipeline to run daily, push to web application through Google Cloud Platform as well as post from Twitter bot through Twitter API
- Leveraged Python CDK (IaC), AWS Lambda, EventBridge, Batch, EC2 Spot Instance, ECR and S3 services as well as Docker containers
- Set up continuous integration and delivery pipeline through GitHub Actions and logging and monitoring pipeline in AWS

### Competition
**Duke Datathon**, Team Project - Winning Submission ([GitHub](https://github.com/unsupervisedlearner1123/Duke-Datathon-2021) | [Research Report](https://github.com/unsupervisedlearner1123/Duke-Datathon-2021/blob/main/40_docs/Report_final.pdf))
- Led team to augment and gain insight on Asian Barometer data by performing factor analysis to produce latent factors from survey questions, which we then predicted using demographic variables while keeping on track for the 24-hour turnaround
- Cleaned up and merged two large, messy datasets over two time periods using Python to get sense of progression over time

### Others
**Leaders in Fortune500**, WIP ([GitHub](https://github.com/dai-anna/Leadership-in-Fortune500))
- Web-scraped for data on leaders in Fortune500 companies (executive board members and c-suite)
- Constructed relational database with scraped data for further analysis
