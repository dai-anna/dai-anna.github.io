ðŸŽ“ I am a currently a second-year Master's student in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. I am passionate about building thoughtfully-engineered and ethical solutions. I aspire to apply my passion for data science and background in regulatory fields to address current issues in data privacy, cybersecurity, and other adversarial attacks. 

ðŸ’¼ I worked in financial services tax compliance and consulting at EY for four years and was inspired by the lack of efficient processes to learn to build automatic, scalable, and reviewable solutions.
