🎓 I am a currently a second-year Master's student in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University and an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. I am passionate about building thoughtfully-engineered, reproducible solutions using creative methods.

💼 I worked in financial services tax compliance and consulting at EY for four years and was inspired by the lack of efficient processes to learn to build automatic, scalable, and reviewable solutions. The move was now or never, so here I am.
