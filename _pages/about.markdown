# A little about me:

ðŸŽ“ I am a currently a first-year Master's student in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University. I am passionate about building thoughtfully-engineered, reproducible solutions using creative and interpretable methods.

ðŸ’¼ I worked in financial services tax compliance and consulting at EY for four years and was inspired by the lack of efficient processes to learn to build automatic, scalable, and reviewable solutions. The move was now or never, so here I am.
