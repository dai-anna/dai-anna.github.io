The opioid crisis is rampant in the United States, yet medical professionals are often overlooked as a group that can be vulnerable to opioid addiction. Drug diversion is the act of stealing prescription drugs from a hospital or pharmacy for personal use or sale. It is estimated that 3% of healthcare workers will misuse drugs at some point in their career. Drug diversion can lead to patient harm, including death, and it can also lead to legal consequences for the healthcare worker. Drug diversion is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.

We worked with anonymized surgical data over the past five years at Duke machine learning model to detect potential cases of drug diversion by anesthesiologists from the Duke University Hospitals.

We worked closely with subject matter experts to understand the nuances of druge diversion and carefully defined our problem. We then developed an ensemble of model systems to detect drug diversion with high sensitivity.

At the end of the project, we presented our system at the Duke MIDS Symposium as the keynote presentation of the year.
